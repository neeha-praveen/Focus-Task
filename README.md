## 🧠 About the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro technique encourages working in focused time blocks, followed by short breaks.  
This helps you stay engaged, avoid burnout, and build consistent progress throughout the day.

This app embraces that rhythm — offering a focused space to manage tasks and time in one place.
